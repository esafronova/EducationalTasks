# Computer Vision

The course 'Computer Vision' is conducted by the [Graphics and Media Lab](https://graphics.cs.msu.ru).

It contains six tasks:

## 1. Combining Image Channels

The task is to process frames from the first color photographs by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in Russia. It is necessary to combine the three channels into a single color image while finding the optimal alignment using Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Correlation.

It is necessary to implement the [`align`](align.py) function, which takes as input an image obtained by scanning a photographic plate and returns the aligned image.
