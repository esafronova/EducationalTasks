This directory contains 9 Jupyter notebooks with various tasks:

### 1. [Demosaicing](demosaicing.ipynb)

The task is to interpolate Bayer pattern.

### 2. [Panorama Stitching](panorama.ipynb)

The task is to create a single panorama from multiple frames taken from the same point but at different angles. To achieve this, we will use ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature descriptors and the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm to estimate model parameters. 
The algorithm takes N frames as input.

### 3. [Convolution and Tensorboard](convolutions_and_tensorboard.ipynb)

The first part of this IPython notebook covers the convolutional layer of a neural network, possible implementations, and special types of convolutional layers.

The second part includes an example of using the TensorBoard utility for visualizing the architecture of the neural network and monitoring various metrics during training and testing (e.g., error, accuracy, etc.)

### 4. [Backpropagation](backprop.ipynb)

There are 4 parts in this assignment :

- Familiarize yourself with the backpropagation method
- Implement forward and backward passes in a neural network
- Implement stochastic gradient descent with momentum
- Train a neural network for handwritten digit classification.

### 5. [IoU Evaluation, Quality Curve Generation, Visualization](detector_visualise_notebook.ipynb)

The task is to learn about methods for evaluating the quality of detectors and the non-maximum suppression algorithm.

### 6. [Semantic Image Segmentation](semantic_segmentation.ipynb)

The task is to explore the algorithm for solving the problem of semantic image segmentation using a fully convolutional neural network and Markov Random Field.

### 7. [Deep Feature Interpolation](deep_feature_interpolation.ipynb)

This is a fairly simple but very interesting approach for semantic modification (morphing) of images. The task is to implement the main components of this algorithm, creating mini-analog of the FaceApp application.

### 8. [Background Subtraction](ViBe.ipynb)

The task is to independently implement the ViBe background subtraction algorithm. Then it is to test this algorithm on the ChangeDetection dataset from 2014 and to compare its performance to an algorithm based on Gaussian mixture models.

### 9. [Epipolar Geometry](epipolar_task.ipynb)

The task is to explore the concepts of epipolar geometry and independently calculate the fundamental matrix. Then it is to construct epipolar lines.
